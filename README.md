# detecting_parkinsons_disease
Using Data Science to predict early stage Parkinson's disease using XGBoost machine learning algorithm and sklearn library for trait normalization

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict early stage Parkinson's disease using the XGBoost algorithm. We will use a dataset from UCI ML Parkinsons to train the model and evaluate its accuracy.

## Technology Description
- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Pandas**: A library for processing and analyzing data.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning used for data normalization and sample separation.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient bousting algorithm to be used for model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A development environment for writing and testing code.
